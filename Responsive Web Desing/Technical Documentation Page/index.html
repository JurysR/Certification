      <p>Dead Cells provides players with Gear in the form of:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Weapons, which have limited but different movesets.</li>
        <li>Skills, which cause a variety of effects but must cool down between uses. </li>
        <li>And Amulets, passive items which grant powerful offensive or defensive benefits. They can also grant points to Brutality, Tactics or Survival</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Gear items are not automatically collected â€” they must be picked up with the Interact key/button. Unwanted gear can usually be converted into gold if the Recycle upgrade has been unlocked.

  Most Gear appears with one or more Affixes, which add effects or situational benefits. Only non-starter, Level 1 Gear, and unique amulets lack affixes. <br>

  If you're looking for a missing item, but you have everything listed below, you might be missing the Merchandise Category upgrade from the Graveyard. </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Biomes">
      <header>Biomes</header>
      <p>Biomes are the different areas within Dead Cells which players must progress through.[1] There are currently twenty-five biomes, with plans to add more.[2] </p>
      <p>Within each run, biomes are procedurally generated within the confines of that biome's set parameters. This puts the focus of gameplay on adaptation rather than memorization, while maintaining each biome's distinct feel.[3] The order in which you'll encounter biomes, and the general location of their exits, are predetermined.

  Excluding boss biomes, each biome always contains a shop and at least one treasure chest. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Enemies">
      <header>Enemies</header>
      <p>Enemies are entities that oppose the player as they navigate the island.

  While Bosses always have the same stats, enemy stats differ depending on the level of the biome where they appear.

  Enemies can drop useful things on death: gold, cells, blueprints, or (rarely) a pickup or item. </p>
      <p>Elite enemies

  Some enemies appear as Elite variants, which are much tougher and slightly larger than normal. At all times, a "name tag" hovers over the enemy marking them as Elite, and an aura surrounds them. Once an Elite enemy attacks the player, the name of the enemy type is briefly shown on screen.

  Elite enemies spawn randomly, or they can be summoned by walking close enough to an Elite obelisk. Wandering Elites can be found mired in a disgusting substance until the player gets close, and then they free themselves and attack. Same goes if they are provoked by Biters or the Homunculus Rune. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Bosses">
      <header>Bosses</header>
      <p>Bosses are a much stronger variant of the Enemies. They have high health, high damage, and many attacks. They are also partly resistant to Status Effects: for example, negative effects inflicted on them expire 20% faster than normal. </p>
      <p>There are currently eight bosses in the game: the Concierge, Conjunctivius, Mama TickTBS, the Time Keeper, the GiantRotG, the ScarecrowFF, the Hand of the King, and a 5 BSC exclusive bossRotG. </p>
      <h3>First bosses</h3>
      <code>The Concierge <br> Conjuctivius <br> Mama Tick</code>
      <h3>Second bosses</h3>
      <code>The Time Keeper <br> The Giant <br> The Scarecrow</code>
      <h3>Third boss</h3>
      <code>The Hand of the King</code>
      <h3>Fourth boss</h3>
      <code>True ending</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Mutations">
      <header>Mutations</header>
      <p>Mutations are passive items that modify and increase the abilities of the player in various ways. They are obtained between levels from Guillain. </p>
      <p>Most mutations are not initially available. To unlock them, one must bring the mutations' blueprints to the Collector, then spend the required Cells. </p>
      <h4>Total of 52 mutations:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>14 for Brutality</li>
        <li>13 for Tactics</li>
        <li>13 for Survival</li>
        <li>12 that are Colorless</li>
